# Music-Recommender-Through-Spotify-Features-Extraction-Data
A machine learning project I did a year back to make a music recommender system
It uses a simple K-mean algorithm to cluster the features after some pre-processing
### To use
1. Unpack data (Source: Kaggle)
2. Run through Jupyter notebook
3. Input a song and the recommender will recommend songs
